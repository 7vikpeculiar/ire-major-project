# Identifying topics/pages to be included in Hindi Wikipedia

We have proposed 3 different ways to expand Hindi Wikipedia:
* Improving breadth of topics by adding new topics of emerging interest. This can be done by scraping Hindi newspapers and identify important events. BBC Hindi was used.
* Improving depth by expansion in categories that are present in the Indian domain. This was done by identifying several articles belonging to broad domains.
* Improving interconnectivity of present topics by adding topics related to a previously existing article. Named entity recognition was performed to identify possible new topics.
